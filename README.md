One-Axis Drill: Design and Fabrication

**Introduction**
Welcome to the One-Axis Drill project! This repository contains the design, fabrication, and implementation details for a one-axis automated drilling machine. The project is intended for students, hobbyists, and professionals interested in mechanical design, CNC machinery, and automation.

Project Overview
The One-Axis Drill is designed to automate the drilling process along a single axis, providing precision and repeatability. It integrates mechanical, electrical, and software components to achieve its goal.

**Features**
Precision Drilling: Accurate drilling along a single axis.
Automated Control: Programmed movements for consistent results.
Customizable Design: Easy to modify for different applications.
Open Source: All design files and source code are available for free.
